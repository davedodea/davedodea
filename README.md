### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for stopping by, here's a little bit about me ...

â„¹ I'm from Galway, a small city on the west coast of Ireland - [here](https://goo.gl/maps/VgC143xCt2VwBQVq6).

ðŸ”­ I've been working as software engineer for a few years now. 
ðŸŒ± Mostly, I work with back-end tech like NodeJS, Python, Express, Flask, Postgres, Rabbit, Redis  and AWS to name but a few.

âš¡ Being fortunate enough to work with a great company [Webtext](https://webtext.com) as well some amazing colleagues allows me to constantly challenge and improve myself. One of the ways I like to give back for this opportunity is by sharing my knowledge with others.

ðŸ’¬ Hopefully, by reading some of my posts on this site, I can help you along in your journey, too.

ðŸ“« I'm always happy to hear from people all over the world, so please do drop me a message here and [say hi](https://daveodea.com/contact/)!

Thanks again for stopping by,
Dave
